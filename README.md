# DIMA259 Final Project


## ℹ️ Overview

This project incorporates HTML, Javascript, and libraries such as p5.js and ml5.js. For our DIMA259 final project, we were asked to create any project that we thought was cool or had some meaning to us. I thought that it would be cool to have something that used the fast-growing machine learning in my project, which was ml5.js. This javascript library aims to make machine learning approachable and accessible to a broad audience. I used ml5.js for this project to track hand movements so the user can draw, as well as identify a set of certain objects all from their webcam.

## Abstract

Synesthesia Canvas is an interactive audiovisual instrument to use real-time hand tracking, voice commands, and image classification to draw with gestures and generate colorful compositions that simultaneously act as graphic scores. By merging gesture, image, and sound, the piece explores themes of embodiment and synesthesia. Synesthesia Canvas is a critique towards the quickly fading human interactivity in our everyday lives, combining it with the evolving machine learning AI.
