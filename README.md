# DIMA259 Final Project


## ℹ️ Overview

Synesthesia Canvas is an interactive audiovisual instrument to use real-time hand tracking, voice commands, and image classification to draw with gestures and generate colorful compositions that simultaneously act as graphic scores. By merging gesture, image, and sound, the piece explores themes of embodiment and synesthesia. Synesthesia Canvas is a critique towards the quickly fading human interactivity in our everyday lives, combining it with the evolving machine learning AI.
